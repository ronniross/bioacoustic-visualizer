# bioacoustic-visualizer

A collection of Python-based scripts designed to transform audio recordings into visual representations (MP4/GIF), through digital signal processing techniques.

## Visualizer Type 1 - 3D-peak-frequency-per-frame

A Python tool that generates animated 3D pitch trajectories from bioacoustic signals. This script calculates STFT, extracts peak frequency/amplitude data over time, and renders a smooth, rotating 3D animation with live frequency tracking.
